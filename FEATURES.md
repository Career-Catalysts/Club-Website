   Who we are.
      Believe it or not, we may be just as lost as you are in your search for an internship. We are mostly a group of Freshman looking to bolster our career and secure a stronghold for our future. So, what better place to start this journey than college? Meanwhile, we believe that our efforts to share resources and knowledge can not only help the community out there yearning towards the same goals, we will also appreciate all the moral support of other grinders out there.

   Who we are not.
      We are not a bunch of Freshman trying to teach about the interviewing process. Rather, we are here to learn with you. That said, we try our best to prepare our meetings such that you learn AT LEAST 1 new valuable thing each time.

   Why we came to be.
      
      Like it or not, especially during this great era where AI is booming, computer science internships AND jobs are only getting more competitive by the year. The ultimate question that brought us together is: How do we improve our chances & stand out? Does that resonate with you?
